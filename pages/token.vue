      <h1 class="text-xl">Introduction</h1>
      <p>RCAX seeks to offer users new ways to engage with Reddit Collectible Avatars. Therefore, we are building two new projects within the RCAX ecosystem: RCAX Trade and RCAX Play. You can read more about these projects below. Concurrently, to facilitate the growth of our ecosystem, we proudly introduce a unifying utility token known as RCAX Token, or simply $RCAX.</p>

      <h1 class="text-xl">RCAX Trade</h1>
      <p>RCAX Trade is the dedicated exchange and trading section of the RCAX ecosystem, catering to users looking to trade and exchange their RCAX Tokens and Reddit Collectible Avatars.</p>

      <h2>Global Trade Center</h2>
      <p>Introducing a dynamic trading hub where users can effortlessly list their Avatars for trade, all while adhering to specific criteria. What truly sets this hub apart from Web3 trading platforms is its instantaneous accessibility to all. Imagine a scenario where an Avatar like "The Hands" is up for trade, contingent upon a condition such as any Gen 1 Avatar with a supply of under 200. What makes this platform unique is that anyone owning Avatars like "Gummy," "Julia Jewels," "Diamond Diable," and more, has the immediate ability to execute this trade. The offeror pays a service fee in $RCAX.</p>

      <h2>Order Book Exchange</h2>
      <p>A conventional order book exchange like Binance, Kraken etc.. But with Avatar pairings. Avatar mint numbers will be ignored, consolidating liquidity and ease of purchase/sale for the end user.</p>

      <h1 class="text-xl">RCAX Play</h1>
      <p>RCAX Play is where the fun happens in the RCAX ecosystem, featuring a mix of games of chance and exciting arcade games.</p>

      <h2>Wonder Trade</h2>
      <p>An Avatar trading system in which users can trade their Avatar against a random partner. The use of this tool will require a fee paid in $RCAX.</p>
